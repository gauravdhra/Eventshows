                Sairyō is a start-up based in Ottawa, Canada with the mission of helping artists monetize their talents online through livestreamed events while also raising money for COVID-19 relief. We cater to a wide variety of artists including musicians, DJ’s, dancers, comedians, chefs and many more. We believe anyone with a talent or skill can be an artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our event platform offers artists the opportunity to create free and paid online events. For all events, attendees have the option to donate to the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Fund. Additionally, artists can choose to donate a portion or all of their earnings towards the COVID-19 Solidarity Fund. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Sairyō has team members all over the world helping us achieve our mission including Canada, Australia, Colombia, India and Lebanon. With a global reach, we hope to provide plenty of much-needed entertainment and financial relief to as many artists and communities as we can.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sairyō will be forever free for the artist. We do not take a cut of event earnings or donations and focus on helping others and raising funds for COVID-19 relief.
